# Hangman Game
A classic childrenâ€™s game to be played by one or two players. The goal of this game is to uncover a word by guessing its letters within a certain number of tries. There are six opportunities to guess a wrong letter before the game ends. If this game is played by one player, a random word will automatically be generated for the player. If there are two players playing, then each player will take turns providing a word for the other to guess. 

This game is recreated with Python, to be run in a shell, and it showcases important concepts such as Object-Oriented Programming, functions, loops, etc. The library of randomly-generated words used for the one-player version of this game is based off the dictionary of words provided by https://github.com/sapbmw/The-Oxford-3000, tweaked to only include only one-word, unhyphenated options. Currently, no data is saved after the script finishes running. 

## To Run:
This Python script can be run on any shell with python3 installed. Just clone the repository and run the script in a shell using "python hangman.py" or "python3 hangman.py".
